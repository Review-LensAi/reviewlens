//! The core engine for the Intelligent Code Review Agent.
//!
//! This crate contains the primary logic for:
//! - Parsing configurations (`config`).
//! - Handling errors (`error`).
//! - Parsing diffs (`diff_parser`).
//! - Interacting with LLM providers (`llm`).
//! - Performing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (`rag`).
//! - Scanning for vulnerabilities and patterns (`scanner`).
//! - Generating reports (`report`).

// Public modules
